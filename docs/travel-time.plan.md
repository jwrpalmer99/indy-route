# Travel Time, World Clock & Player Speed

## Four features implemented together

---

## Feature 1 — World Clock Advance

When a GM-broadcast route finishes animating, advance `game.time.worldTime`
by the in-game travel duration derived from the route's travel mode.

### How duration is calculated

```
totalPx       = sum of segment lengths in the path array
totalUnits    = (totalPx / gridSize) * distancePerSquare
travelSeconds = (totalUnits / speedMph) * 3600
```

`distancePerSquare` comes from (in priority order):
1. Scene distance override flag (`MODULE_ID.sceneDistance.distancePerSquare`)
2. `canvas.scene.grid.distance`

`speedMph` comes from the route's `travelModeId` → `DEFAULT_TRAVEL_MODES[id].speedMph`.

### Clock advance call

```js
await game.time.advance(Math.round(travelSeconds));
```

Both **Simple Calendar** and **Seasons & Stars** automatically listen to
`game.time.worldTime` updates — no module-specific hook is needed.

### Module setting

`worldClockEnabled` (Boolean, GM-only, default `false`) — a global on/off
switch so GMs can opt in without touching their calendar module.

## Feature 2 — Per-scene Distance Scale Override

Foundry's `canvas.scene.grid.distance` is meant for combat squares (e.g. "5 ft").
On a geo-scale overland map, the GM needs to say "1 square = 100 miles" without
changing the combat grid distance.

Store as a scene flag: `MODULE_ID → sceneDistance`

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "distancePerSquare": 100,
  "units": "miles"
}
```

Accessible via a "Scene Scale" button in the Route Manager toolbar.
Opens `SceneSettingsDialog` (a compact `ApplicationV2`).

`manager.js → _getRouteLengthLabel()` and `clock.js → computeTravelSeconds()`
both check the flag before falling back to `canvas.scene.grid.distance`.

## Feature 3 — Player Speed Selection Dialog

Before a player submits a pathfinding proposal, a compact modal appears:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  🚶 Choose Travel Speed      │
│                             │
│  ○ Walking (Slow)   2 mph   │
│  ● Walking (Normal) 3 mph   │
│  ○ Walking (Fast)   4 mph   │
│  ○ Horseback        6 mph   │
│  ○ (other modes…)          │
│                             │
│  [Submit]  [Cancel]         │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Returns the selected travel mode id.  
If the GM approval mode is ON, the mode id is visible in the approval panel.

### `drawSpeed` adjustment

The route's `drawSpeed` is scaled relative to **Walking (Normal)** (3 mph):

```js
effectiveDrawSpeed = baseDraw * (selectedMph / 3)
```

This makes horseback routes animate visibly faster than a slow walk.

### Proposal payload additions

```js
proposal.travelModeId   = "horseback"
proposal.travelModeLabel = "Horseback"  // display only
```

---

## Feature 4 — Encounter Chance Scaling by Speed

Each `DEFAULT_TRAVEL_MODE` gains an `encounterMult` field (default `1.0`):

| Mode | encounterMult | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Walking (Slow) | 0.7 | Careful, observant |
| Walking (Normal) | 1.0 | Baseline |
| Walking (Fast) | 1.3 | Less watchful |
| Horseback | 1.6 | Noise + speed |
| Coach / Orien Coach | 1.4 | Road noise |
| Lightning Rail | 0.5 | Well-defended, fast |
| Sailing / Galleon | 1.2 | Visible at sea |
| Elemental Galleon | 0.8 | Faster, more defended |
| Elemental Airship | 0.4 | High altitude |

In `handleZoneFired(zone, routeId, pos, travelModeId)`:

```js
const mult = getTravelMode(travelModeId)?.encounterMult ?? 1.0;
const effectiveChance = Math.min(1, zone.chance * mult);
if (Math.random() > effectiveChance) return; // miss
```
