- *(pending)* — 2026-06-13 — Fix `applyColorNumbers` for hex strings without leading `#`; add `.gitignore` and `.vscode/settings.json`

### Fixed
- **`scripts/settings.js`** — `applyColorNumbers` and `getSettings` now correctly parse hex colour strings that lack a leading `#` (e.g. `"ff6400"`). Extracted shared `_hexToNum` helper to remove duplicated parsing logic.

### Added — Testing Infrastructure
- **`package.json`**: Dev dependencies for Vitest 1.x, Playwright 1.x, and `@vitest/coverage-v8`. Five npm scripts: `test`, `test:watch`, `coverage`, `test:integration`, `foundry:wait`.
- **`vitest.config.js`**: Node environment, `tests/setup.js` for global stubs, V8 coverage with 70 % line/function thresholds.
- **`tests/setup.js`**: Comprehensive Foundry VTT global mocks (`canvas`, `game`, `CONST`, `foundry`, `Hooks`, `ui`, `Roll`, `PIXI`, etc.) using `vi.stubGlobal` — no browser required for unit tests.
- **`tests/unit/astar.test.js`**: 10 unit tests covering open-grid paths, wall avoidance, node-budget enforcement, custom `isPassable` filters, and edge cases (same cell, adjacent cell, null grid).
- **`tests/unit/proposals.test.js`**: 10 unit tests for `ProposalStore` (add, get, remove, getAll, clear, duplicate-id overwrite, snapshot immutability).
- **`tests/unit/change-level.test.js`**: 18 unit tests for `TravelerChangeLevelBehavior` helpers (`_checkPrerequisites` — status/item/combined requirements, invalid regex; `_resolveTargetElevation` — explicit, levelId, fallback null).
- **`tests/unit/settings.test.js`**: 16 unit tests for `normalizeSettings`, `applyColorNumbers`, `applyMapScaling`, `PLAYER_ROUTE_MODE`, and `getPlayerRouteMode`.
- **`tests/quench/fixtures.js`**: `SceneFixture.build()` programmatically creates a 1000×1000 scene with a gapped vertical wall, a stairs region, a cliff/check region, and a test token. `teardown()` deletes the scene. `WallFixture.createHorizontal()` for ad-hoc walls.
- **`tests/quench/pathfinding.quench.js`**: Integration tests for A* on the real `canvas` (open grid, wall avoidance via gap, fully-walled destination, node-budget timing).
- **`tests/quench/region-behavior.quench.js`**: Integration tests for `traveler.changeLevel` behaviors (prerequisite blocking, prerequisite pass, `_applyElevation` updating `TokenDocument.elevation`).
- **`tests/quench/player-route.quench.js`**: Integration tests for the player-route workflow (ProposalStore round-trip with real UUIDs, MSG constant uniqueness, `IndyRouteRenderer.render` smoke test, proposal approve/reject cycle).
- **`tests/quench/index.js`**: Registers all three Quench batches via `Hooks.once("quenchReady", ...)` and exports `registerAllSuites` for dynamic import.
- **`tests/world/world.json`**: Minimal Foundry world manifest for the CI Docker container (`traveler-ci`, dnd5e system, `traveler` + `quench` modules). No scene data committed.
- **`docker-compose.test.yml`**: Spins up `felddy/foundryvtt:14`, mounts module source and test world, exposes port 30000, health-checks `/api/status`.
- **`scripts/foundry-wait.js`**: Polls `/api/status` every 5 s until Foundry is ready or times out (configurable via `FOUNDRY_WAIT_TIMEOUT`).
- **`scripts/run-quench.js`**: Playwright headless driver — navigates to Foundry, joins as GM, calls `quench.runAll()`, collects pass/fail stats, exits 0 or 1 for CI.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: Two-job Actions workflow: `unit-tests` (Vitest + coverage artifact) and `integration-tests` (Docker + Playwright + Quench). Integration job skipped on fork PRs where secrets are unavailable.
- **`docs/testing.plan.md`**: Plan document describing the full testing architecture, Vitest rationale, Quench overview, Docker setup, and CI environment guidance (GitHub Actions vs CircleCI).

### Added
- `architecture.md` — full module documentation including Mermaid class, sequence, and data-flow diagrams.

### Added (Player Pathfinding — Phase 1 + 2)
- **`playerRouteMode` setting** — world-scope GM setting: `off` (default), `immediate` (player routes play without approval), `approval` (GM queue).
- **`PlayerRouteTool`** (`scripts/tool-player.js`) — player-facing canvas tool activated via toolbar button (visible when `playerRouteMode ≠ off`). Player selects their token, clicks a destination, A* computes the route, preview renders in the player's color; Enter submits, Esc cancels.
- **A* pathfinder** (`scripts/pathfinding/astar.js`) — grid-aware shortest-path engine using `canvas.grid.getNeighbors`, `canvas.walls.checkCollision`, and a binary min-heap. 2 500-node budget prevents browser freeze; returns a partial path to the closest expanded node if the budget is hit.
- **Fog-of-war gating** (`scripts/pathfinding/fog-checker.js`) — samples `canvas.visibility.explored` (a PIXI.RenderTexture) to block unexplored cells in pathfinding. Degrades gracefully when the texture is unavailable.
- **Fog-boundary anchor** — when A* terminates at the fog edge, a pulsing ring is drawn at the last reachable node. The `sightRefresh` Foundry hook automatically re-runs pathfinding when vision expands. Clicking near the anchor starts a new path leg from that point.
- **Region passability** — during pathfinding, cells inside regions are evaluated: `traveler.changeLevel` regions are passable (the check fires at playback time); `core.teleportToken` is passable; any other behavior type blocks the cell.
- **GM approval workflow** (`scripts/proposals.js`, `ProposalStore`) — ephemeral in-memory queue of `PlayerRouteProposal` objects. On submit in approval mode, a socket message (`TRAVELER_PLAYER_PROPOSE`) delivers the proposal to the GM. The Route Manager shows a **Player Proposals** section with Preview (4 s preview animation), Approve (plays route for all clients), and Reject (optional reason, notifies player) buttons.
- **Proposal socket messages** added to `constants.js`: `TRAVELER_PLAYER_IMMEDIATE`, `TRAVELER_PLAYER_PROPOSE`, `TRAVELER_PLAYER_APPROVE`, `TRAVELER_PLAYER_REJECT`.
- **Plan document** saved to `docs/player-pathfinding.plan.md`.

### Added (Region Behavior — `traveler.changeLevel`)
- **`TravelerChangeLevelBehavior`** (`scripts/behaviors/change-level.js`) — custom `RegionBehaviorType` registered as `traveler.changeLevel`.  GMs configure it via the standard Foundry RegionConfig panel.  Fields: `mode`, `targetLevelId`, `targetElevation`, `requiredStatusEffect`, `requiredItemPattern`, `requiresCheck`, `checkLabel`, `checkFormula`, `checkDC`, `failureDamage`, `allowRetry`.
- **Five traversal modes** — `stairs` (automatic), `ladder` (interact), `cliff` (check required), `drop` (fall), `fly-only`.
- **Prerequisite gate** — status-effect check (`actor.statuses.has`) and item-name regex (`actor.items`) evaluated before any roll; blocks movement with a `ui.notifications.warn` on failure.
- **Roll-check dialog** (`scripts/behaviors/level-check-dialog.js`, `templates/level-check-dialog.hbs`) — awaitable `ApplicationV2` with "Attempt" (evaluates Roll formula, posts to chat) and "Give Up" (cancels movement) buttons.
- **Retry loop** — when `allowRetry` is true and the roll fails, a `DialogV2.confirm` prompt lets the player try again; movement stays paused at the boundary until pass, cancel, or final failure.
- **Failure damage** — if `failureDamage` is set, a damage roll is evaluated and posted to chat; applied via `actor.applyDamage(total)` (dnd5e), or a direct `system.attributes.hp.value` update, or a manual-apply warning as fallback.
- **Elevation write on success** — `tokenDoc.update({ elevation })` called after `continueMovement` using `targetElevation` or the Scene Level's `elevation.bottom`.
- **No socket work needed** — `TOKEN_MOVE_IN` with `event.user.isSelf` guard ensures the dialog runs on the correct player's client; all movement control calls are local.

### Added (v14 Scene Levels — breaks v13 compatibility)
- **Per-point elevation capture** — each waypoint now records the `elevation.bottom` of `canvas.level` at click time. Routes drawn on multi-level scenes automatically carry elevation data across level transitions.
- **Arc-length elevation interpolation** — `buildElevationsForPath()` in `routes.js` produces a per-path-point elevation array by interpolating between waypoints in arc-length space, so smooth/resampled paths get accurate elevation values even after Catmull-Rom or Chaikin processing.
- **Token elevation during playback** — `renderer.js` now passes the interpolated elevation to every `TokenDocument.update()` call (snap-to-start, per-frame throttled update, and final position), keeping a token's `elevation` property in sync with the route as it animates.
- **Level picker in Route Editor** — the General tab in the route editor now shows a "Scene Level" `<select>` populated from `canvas.scene.levels` when the scene has levels defined. Saving the editor resolves `defaultElevation` from the chosen level's `elevation.bottom`.
- **Level badge in Route Manager** — each route row shows a small `<i class="fa-layer-group"> Level name</i>` badge when the route has an associated Scene Level, resolved via `levelId` or `defaultElevation`.
- **`levelId` and `defaultElevation` fields** — added to `DEFAULTS` and `normalizeSettings()` in `settings.js`; flow transparently through all existing serialization / deserialization paths including export/import.
- **Elevation preserved on import and point-edit** — `_importRoutes` and `_editRoutePoints` in `manager.js` now forward the `elevation` property on each point so multi-level route data round-trips cleanly.
- **Graceful single-level fallback** — `getCanvasPos()` in `tool.js` and `buildElevationsForPath()` both return `0` / `null` when `canvas.level` is absent, leaving single-level scenes completely unaffected.

### Changed (Foundry v14 API uplift)
- **`getSceneControlButtons` hook** — toolbar button callbacks changed from `onClick` to `onChange`; added required `order` property to both toolbar tools.
- **`ApplicationV2.render`** — all `render(true)` calls updated to `render({ force: true })` to match the v14 options-object signature.
- **`ImageHelper`** — upload path migrated from `foundry.utils.ImageHelper.uploadBase64(base64, { folder, filename })` to `foundry.helpers.media.ImageHelper.uploadBase64(base64, fileName, filePath)` with fallback to the v13 path.
- **`loadTexture`** — global `loadTexture` removed in v14; all calls now use `foundry.canvas.loadTexture` directly.
- **`saveDataToFile`** — global removed in v14; updated to `foundry.utils.saveDataToFile`.
- **Fog of war refresh** — added `canvas?.visibility?.refresh?.()` alongside `canvas?.sight?.refresh?.()` for cross-version compatibility (`canvas.sight` renamed to `canvas.visibility` in v14).
- **`module.json`** — `compatibility.verified` bumped from `13` to `14`; minimum remains `13`.

### Changed (fork rename: `indy-route` → `traveler`)
- Module `id` changed to `"traveler"` in `module.json`.
- `MODULE_ID` in `settings.js` updated to `"traveler"`.
- Entry point renamed from `scripts/indy-route.js` to `scripts/traveler.js`; `module.json` `esmodules` updated accordingly.
- Socket message types renamed: `INDY_ROUTE` → `TRAVELER_ROUTE`, `INDY_CLEAR_ROUTE` → `TRAVELER_CLEAR_ROUTE`, `INDY_CLEAR` → `TRAVELER_CLEAR`.
- Toolbar tool keys renamed: `indyRouteStart` → `travelerStart`, `indyRouteClear` → `travelerClear`.
- ApplicationV2 `id` and `classes` renamed across all apps (`indy-route-*` → `traveler-*`).
- Window titles updated to `"Traveler …"`.
- Global PIXI state key renamed: `window.__indyRouteBroadcast` → `window.__travelerBroadcast`.
- PIXI container property keys renamed: `indyRouteTokenSprite/State` → `travelerTokenSprite/State`; `indyRouteLabelSprite/LastArgs/InFlight/Pending/UpdateToken` → `travelerLabel*`.
- Tile export folder and filenames: `"indy-route"` / `indy-route-*.png` → `"traveler"` / `traveler-*.png`.
- SVG path IDs: `indy-route-label-*` → `traveler-label-*`.
- Debug flag: `window.INDY_ROUTE_DEBUG` → `window.TRAVELER_DEBUG`.
- CSS classes in all `.hbs` templates: `.indy-route-*` → `.traveler-*`.
